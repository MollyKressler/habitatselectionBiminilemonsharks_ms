#### Troubleshooting assigning habitat to point location data?

Code files STEP 1 and STEP 2 may be of particular use to those who wish to assign areas of shapefiles (e.g. habitat) to biologging detections of animals which have 'buffers' around them. Buffers describe the potential location error, e.g. the detection range in acoustic telemetry, where the animal has equal likelihood of occuring based on the point-detection.
